- Notes: 
	 - We are beings that exist in a world not made for our biology. Our adaptions thus far have been in spite of our natural predispositions. [[Biases]] and ape thinking are our enemy in the modern world, but only if we do not understand them. Disagreements are one such thing. Pre-civilization, arguments were to actively be avoided as they challenged the groups ability to stay together. Our fight or flight response to disagreements is the same with how we respond to physical threat. Both, however are incompatible with modern times. We must do neither. We must actively rise to the threat and work it out. The internet makes it particularly difficult. Use of moralizing language and the ability to hide behind our screens makes it incredibly simple to disagree with someone. In person, this would not be the case. 

	 - Niceties may save us in person, but these same rules of conduct do not extend to digital spaces. Manners and rules that allow us to have productive conversations in person are non-existent for the most part. That is why forums like changemyview are important; they allow us to have shared sets of rules that govern how we talk to one another, and they often times lead to productive disagreements.
