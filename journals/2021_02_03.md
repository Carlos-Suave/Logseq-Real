	 - 1. What am I grateful for?
		 - The homies, [[Jake Blair]] if he finds me a job. 

	 - 2. What do I want todayâ€™s highlight to be?
		 - Applyin to some jobs, not getting yelled at by [[Kathy]]

	 - 3. Daily affirmations
		 - You're not doing anything wrong. These things take time. 

	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - Gotta somehow fix my relationship with Kathy and my Dad or just move out, I guess.  It would just be so much easier to move out when I have a job, and, if I maintain that relationship, my dad will help me move. It just doesn't make sense to move and then move again, really. I don't think they understand that I'm not trying to be some fucking washed up bum. Maybe I just have to show them that I'm dedicated to finding a job. I probably shouldn't tell them how much I make on unemployment. How much money is 5k really? Is that enough to find a place on my own, but who would accept me; I don't have a job. Damn, life would just be so much easier if I found a job. Shoulda started earlier. Maybe I could go back to school? I should keep going ahead and looking at places in D.C.  

	 - 5. What am I worried about?
		 - Having to move out. Not necessarily scared, but it would be a lame thing to have to do right now. 

	 - 6. Day Recall
