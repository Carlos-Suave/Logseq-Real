- Notes:
	 - Intuitively, it follows that individuals who are under crushing amounts of [[debt]] will choose the option that more quickly allows them to pay back those bills.  Our system of debt in the [[U.S]], especially for medical students, results in far more inefficiencies than just individuals having large amounts of debt. Not only does it prevent certain individuals from going to college who it otherwise would be economically beneficial for them to do so, but it prevents new graduates from fully participating in the economy. Instead, it saddles them with debt that does nobody but big corporations any good generally, especially when the loans are privately held.
