- Why are drugs addictive? #Box5
	 - Because they stimulate the mesolimbic pathway. Releasing dopamine into the nucleus accumbens, a part of the limbic system. 

- What is the opposite of pleasure? #Box5
	 - Anhedonia - the inability to experience pleasure.

- What does the release of dopamine into the nigrostriatal pathway cause us to do? 
	 - Act or react - motivating us to move?

- What common disease is associated with deficits of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway?
	 - Parkinson's - extreme difficulty in acting out their intentions. 

- What are endorphins? 
	 - Natural compounds that stimulate dopamine release, relieve pain, and relieve stress.

- What're the 3 laws of psychopharmacology? 
	 - All drugs act by changing the rate of what is already going on.

	 - All drugs have side effects.

	 - The brain adapts to all drugs by counteracting the drug's effects.

- Drugs merely mimic the shapes of naturally occurring molecules in the brain. 

- Why do all drugs have side effects? #Box4
	 - Since neurotransmitters such as serotonin have many different jobs depending on where they are released in the body, drugs that flood the body with serotonin will end up affecting all of these sites, instead of just one. 

- What does tachyphylaxis mean? 
	 - Acute tolerance. It is the brains immediate adaptive response to changes in the brain.

- For antidepressants, adaptation is actually the goal, causing your brain to change a "set point," so that being depressed is no longer the patients normal state. 

- A 'b' process, or the brains response to any change caused by drugs, is a adaptive process that gets better with experience in whatever drug is causing the change in stimulus. B processes may be elicited by any stimuli that merely promise the corresponding A process is coming, i.e. Pavlov's dogs. 

- THC binds with receptors nearly all over the brain, much unlike other drugs that target specific receptors in specific regions. There is a shocking amount of cannabinoid receptors. 

- What does the cannabinoid system do? 
	 - It helps sort our experiences, highlighting some as more important than others.

- What is downregulation and how does our brain downregulate pot? 
	 - Downregulation describes the processes that ensure to work homeostasis; in the case of pot, cb receptors are reduced in number and sensitivity. 

- Marijuana usage leads to downregulation and it's effects: dependence, irritability, and an ability to see the world as vivid without the drug. Intermittent use is important to avoiding downregulation.

- What's the umbrella term for all opiates? 
	 - Narcotics. 

- What percentage of Americans will take opiates in their lifetime? 
	 - 1/5

- What percentage of overdose survivors continue to use opioids? 
	 - 91%

- '   ' is the medical term for pain relief #Box4
	 - Analgesia.

- What does the natural production of opioids do for us? #Box5
	 - Allow us to inhibit pain, stress, and fear during dangerous situations, allowing us to potentially fight or escape. They also modulate activities like sex, attachment, and learning. 

- What do anti-opioids do for us? 
	 - Provide us relief from the mind-altering effects of opioids in order to teach us and allow us to proceed sober through the situation. It hurts, a lot. They also just work to restore our baseline.

- In an experiment performed on rats, the rats were subjected to stressful stimuli, and, after repeated trials, began to synthesize their own opioids in anticipation of the stressful event. 

- In the same experiment, a light was immediately shown after the stressful stimuli, signaling the end of it.  Soon, the light alone would be enough to stimulate the production of anti-opiates. Even the effects of an injection of morphine would quickly be nullified by the anti-opiates currently present in the body. 

- '  ' is the term for those without smell. #Box4
	 - Anosmic

- Pain is perhaps one of the most important sensations that we have. Compared to those with the inability to see, smell, hear, or feel, the inability to feel pain is practically a death-sentence. 

- Unlike other sensations, which have relatively simplistic, straightforward pathways in the brain, the sensation of pain is incredibly redundant, signifying it's evolutionary importance. 

- Triggers that remind a former addict of their opioid usage can still be enough to stimulate the anti-opiate system—even years after regular use. 

- Opioid adaptation and tolerance is much stronger than other classes of drugs.  Addicts can use up to 150 the dose that would be lethal to a non-user. 

- What are some of the effects of opioids? 
	 - Tranquility, relaxation, sleepiness, constipation, reduced sex drive, reduced respiration, analgesia, euphoria, pupil constriction, decreased blood pressure, decreased core temperature.

- What are some of the effects of anti-opiates? 
	 - Irritability, diarrhea, pupil dilation, increased core temp, increased sex drive, increased blood pressure, pain, runny nose, fearfulness, panting.

- Why is the prescription of methadone perhaps inhumane? 
	 - Because it is an incredibly long-lasting opiate. It confers upon them an even increased reliance on drugs. Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease. 

- What are the many treatment options available for opiate addicts? #Box4
	 - Methadone, a strong opiate that is used in managing withdrawal symptoms. 

	 - Narcan, an anti-opiate which will cause the brain to upregulate the opioid system. 

	 - Suboxone and buprenorphine, an anti-opiate and opioid, respectively, that promises upregulation whilst still managing withdrawal symptoms. 

- There is good evidence to suggest that individuals who are more likely to spend time in certain predisposing states—such as, boredom, anxiety, or pain—are more likely to abuse the complementary substance.

- It's a destructive cycle, however. Someone who naturally tends to be anxious, and who imbibes in alcohol to compensate, will become dependent on that drug as their baseline becomes more and more anxious.

- What causes asian flush? #Box5
	 - A naturally occurring deficiency in the enzyme that metabolizes acetaldehyde.

- Negative reinforcement doesn't work. Individuals, despite having full knowledge of the negative consequences of their actions, will continue to engage in those behaviors. 

- When was distillation invented, by who, and why is it a problem? 
	 - By the Greeks around the first century A.D, it's a problem because it allows for much higher concentrations of alcohol. 

- Why are the effects of alcohol so difficult to understand? 
	 - It's very small size allows it to bind to many more molecules than say THC or cocaine. Thus, having a wide range of effects. 

- How does alcohol work? #Box4
	 - By facilitating GABA neurotransmission, one of the most common neurotransmitters and the most prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter. It slows down our brain, basically.

	 - Reduces activity at glutamate receptors. It is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter and is involved in memories.  

- What percentage of your likelihood to develop alcohol addiction is due to genetics? 
	 - About 50-60%

	 - Natural variances in the amount of beta-endorphin that alcohol produces in the body is the reason why. 

- Why does alcohol withdrawal cause seizures sometimes. #Box5
	 - Because the increase of glutamate sensitivity caused by adaptation in response to alcohol. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter and this increase in neuroexcitability can cause seizures.

- What is a seizure?

- What is one of the easiest ways to reduce alcohol dependency in youth? #Box
	 - Not letting them drink when they're younger. Those who start young are 4 times more likely to develop a substance abuse problem. 

- Who synthesized the first barbiturate and when? #Box5
	 - Adolf von Baeyer in 1864.

- The issue with the intended effects of barbiturates is that they soon cause the opposite intended effect: restlessness and manic.

- What is the most prescribed drug for epilepsy? #Box5
	 - Phenobarbital.

- What did Marilyn Monroe die of, and when did she die? #Box5
	 - August 5, 1962. She died of overdose of barbiturates.

- What did the CIA use barbiturates for in the 1940's and 50's? #Box5
	 - Essentially a truth serum type of thing. 

- How do benzo's and barbiturates work? #Box4
	 - They're essentially alcohol in a pill. They reduce the excitability of GabaA, the primary inhibitory neuro transmitter that modulates virtually every brain circuit.

- Benzos are much safer than barbiturates because barbiturates can mimic GABA receptors and open the chloride channel much easier. 

- What are drugs that target anxiety called? #Box5
	 - Anxiolytics.

- What percentage of kids 4 or older have an ADHD diagnosis? #Box5
	 - 12 %

- Why is caffeine not considered addictive? #Box5
	 - Because it's not harmful.

- How does caffeine work? #Box4
	 - It is an adenosine antagonist, filling up the receptors that adenosine would fill. Adenosine naturally binds to receptors over the day and causes drowsiness. 

- How many people smoke tobacco? #Box5
	 - Over 1.1 billion. 

- How many years does the average tobacco smoker lose? #Box5
	 - 15 years.

- Cigarettes are metabolized in the liver by a specific enzyme called cytochrome p450 2a6 (CYP2A6). Some people have a mutation that slows down nicotine metabolism; thus, making them less likely to be addicted because they'll have too much nicotine in their system. 

- How does cocaine, amphetamines, and mdma work? #Box5
	 - By blocking the ability of transporter cells to recycle neurotransmitters so that dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine stays in the synaptic gap longer. 

- What does the introduction of a methyl group do to amphetamine? #Box5
	 - Increases absorption and distribution. 

- Molly damages nerve terminals permanently, especially to sertonergic neurons.
