		 - Knee isn't getting a whole lot better, but I'm not sure what that's due to. I've been relatively on top of doing the recommended exercise, but that doesn't seem to be enough. I don't think it would make that much of a difference had I been strict with my exercises. They never texted back for an appointment: seems lazy. I know I can do work at home if I need to, it's just a lot easier when you don't have distractions and a million things to do; however, for efficiency purposes, it's sometimes better to just get my morning journaling done at home. Oh god if I have [[Covid]] I'm gonna freak out.

I really don't know what will happen to my relationships if I end up giving this disease to people that I like. My phones a big distraction when I. I should just start learning python, shouldn't I? It's a relatively marketable skill and will help me understand tech better if I decide to do such. Agile and all that other bullshit is something that I can learn on the job, but I think tech companies will be surprised and excited if I'm able to do the most basic of coding. It's just also good to understand it because you understand the time constraints that go on during crunch time and what not. I should set a strict schedule. Maybe not strict necessarily. Oh I should use that one app. Noted? 3? [[Sorted]]. Close enough. I'll get that all figured out today as well.
