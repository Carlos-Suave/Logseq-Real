- People attach their ego to their beliefs, so arguments are not simple abstract games of thought where you play around and take things lightly. They are sometimes so essential to our core beliefs that we feel as if we are being attacked physically. You can, however, de-personalize these arguments so that they don't reach a boiling point of personal attacks. You de-personalize by not using "you" language and by not attacking the indiviudual ad-hominem. You need to take them away from their allies and from situations where they might be expected to defend the position. When you take them away, they don't feel as if they're defending their identity because it isn't as tied up as it was. No one will know. Lowering identity stakes is important. You need to give your opponent face.
