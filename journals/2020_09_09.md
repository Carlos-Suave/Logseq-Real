	 - 1. What am I grateful for?
		 - As always, my great friends and loved ones. I have a good relationship with them all currently, especially my mom. I'm grateful that she has someone in her life; although, that's probably just selfish of me since I don't want to do any additional emotional labor. 

	 - 2. What do I want todayâ€™s highlight to be?
		 - I just want to stay focused. I'm excited for [[Stephanie]] to be gone for a while so I can hang with the boys! 

	 - 3. Daily affirmations
		 - You are loved. 

	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - I'm wondering if something like short term memory can be trained while I'm this old or if I'll always feel like kind of behind when it comes to memory. This is honestly a pretty big stressor for me, especially when I'm confronted with people like [[Stephanie]], but I think it's something that can be improved upon. Really, the issue is that I never find myself paying attention to anyone when they talk. [[Stephanie]], conversely, is so intent and focused on people when they talk. 

		 - The lacrosse ball felt really good today, and I it will end up doing a lot of good if I stay regular with the activity. There seems to be so much misinformation and bad science in the sport science field that I don't know what to think. I wonder if there is a way I can get to a point of actual fluency in this research. That seems like a pretty long goal, but I'll add it to the learn pile. That's something I'm really excited about, but I'm not sure what I can get accomplished in only a week? There's so much time to do stuff and so little time to learn anything. I really admire people who always seek out learning and are generally interested in what their friends and coworkers have to say. I'm going to make a template for people that I can fill out whenever I do something with them.
