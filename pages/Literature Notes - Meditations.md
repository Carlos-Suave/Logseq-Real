- He himself was living proof the that the fieriest energy is not incompatible with the ability to relax.

- It was the critic Alexander who put me on guard against unnecessary fault finding. 37

- Book one details the people that Marcus Aurelius is indebted to for the existence of himself, his abilities, and his disposition. 

- Do not be involved in the wickedness of others but understand that they are your brother. Understand that what is wicked can not hurt you as long as you understand what is good.

- Don't let your reason be a slave to interests.

- Think of procrastination, and think about all of the chances you've had after it. Don't continue to wait for something, strike at it. Your time is limited. Use it to advance your enlightenment. 46

- Allow your mind freedom from all other considerations. dismissing the wayward thought, the emotional recoil from doing what is necessary, the desire to create an impression, the admiration of self, and the discontent with your lot. You only need to do a little bit of this for life to flow in goodness. 46

- Everything is fading and temporary. Be wary of the one whose word confers reputation, as that is also fading. Death too, once stripped of it's untrue associations, is no big a deal. 49 

- Men's ignorance of good and evil - an infirmity as crippling as the inability to distinguish black and white. 

- Wrongs are self-inflicted, quarreling with circumstances of nature, against eachother, to surrender to pleasure or pain, to show incincerity, to direct one's energies to no particular object. 50

- Life is short, and the only thing that keeps that journey focused is philosophy. 

- Don't be preoccupied with the happenings of others, unless to some mutual benefit, anything that distracts you from the fidelity to the ruler within you means a loss of opportunity for some other task. 

- A man should habituate himself to thinking such that if someone asked what was on their mind they would be able to respond frankly and quickly.

- We have to stand upright ourselves, not be set up. 57

- Determine what is best for you by realizing your status as reasonable and different from animals. 

- No other care but to stray from the paths incompatible to an intelligent being. 

- Life is fleeting, remember that you only live in the present, everything else is dead and gone or yet to occur. 

- Examine everything. Identify for yourself the object or experience and what it means. What does it ask of me? What does it come from?

- Book Three:
	 - Life is short and fleeting, guide yourself through philosophy and live in accordance with reason. Don't let others affect you, don't be interested in the happenings of gossip and hate, stay focused and be yourself, live in the present and welcome everything as equal. Nothing can damage your mind but you. Be direct in everything you do.
