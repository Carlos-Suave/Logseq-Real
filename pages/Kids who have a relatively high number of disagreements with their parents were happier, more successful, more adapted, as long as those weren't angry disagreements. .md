- Disagreements are a powerful force for letting yourself be known. Without them, often times individuals will suffer in silence when they can't be heard. Couples who have more arguments are also happier. Arguments also help you sort out your own thoughts and examine them properly. Perhaps, cognitively it benefited kids because they had to think long and hard about why they wanted to argue. Kids, however, are kids and at the end of the day need to feel loved above all else. That's why angry disagreements didn't help. Not only that, but angry disagreements are often fruitless games of escalation where one side is constantly threatened and the other side is coming from a one-down mentality. Kids also don't like to feel like they're fighting against their parents, so because we're naturally inclined to view arguments as a threat of physical violence, kids must be terrified to even try arguing with their parents if they know it could escalate into violence. I wonder how far does this extend? Inmates probably feel like kids unable to argue with those who maintain their captivity. Would the benefits of argumentation extend to them? 

- Argumentation exposes the problems and instigates some change. Think of resetting your mind to view arguments as a dance, not an attack. Often times we use language like he destroyed, or eviscerated, or got murdered. Obviously, these aren't productive images. Arguments lead to healthier and more open relationships.
