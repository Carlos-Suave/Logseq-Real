	 - 1. What am I grateful for?
		 - The homies.

	 - 2. What do I want today’s highlight to be?
		 - Well I already applied to a lot of jobs, so I guess hearing something positive back from 1 of them, or just moving my desk.

	 - 3. Daily affirmations
		 - You're so smart and handsome. 

	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - Oops should probably stop talking to Grace like this; I need to think of something to get Steph for valentines day, but I wasn't even sure if she was gonna be in town so oof. Probably need to keep my phone away from me when I do work; it's my downfall. I think maybe after this week I should start applying to policy analyst positions instead of project management positions, because I don't know if this is gonna work out. I haven't really gotten any interviews—Goldman Sachs, but that doesn't really count—and I think it's a futile effort for the most part. I'll just need to find a good writing sample I'm proud of and send it in to peeps in D.C. I wonder if there's a website like builtinChi for political science job—probably not. 

	 - 5. What am I worried about?

	 - 6. Day Recall
