	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - I have absolutely no clue what to do about Steph hahaha. Oh shit, I have to work out today, don't I? Well let me just get in a groove real quick, then. I keep getting tickets even though we should be done with odd/even parking! There's no snow on the ground! Absolute bullshit, honestly. Parking services are such pricks. Not the people, obviously, just the institution itself. I understand it, but I don't really understand odd/even that well. Eh, I'm just being a bit of a baby, aren't I? Investments are just all about luck to some extent, and that's kind of frustrating. Why did I choose the wrong stocks? Why did I choose the wrong time to buy. I should just sell my Hasbro stock. I should also just put my money into an investment account, because I don't think I have the DD to make wise investments. God people in the library who talk are literally the worst. They should be bombed from the heavens. Ugh, I don't really want to talk; I feel pretty rough today. I wonder why that is. Well, I should just get to crackin on my applications. Maybe that will help me recover from my funk.
