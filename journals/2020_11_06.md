	 - 1. What am I grateful for?

	 - 3. Daily affirmations
		 - Vyvanse is helping, you just gotta taaaake it slow.

	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - I'm thinking about [[Stephanie]] and how we talk to each other. I'm trying to get to the point where we can talk freely about things and where I don't feel weird or strange for bringing certain things up. Obviously, we're to that point to some degree, but I think it would open up even more conversations. I miss her, but maybe I'm just horny. I wish these stupid things would get back to me in time; why does applying for jobs take so damn long? I guess I can update my application on that Microsoft one. Damn that would've been sick just to get an interview there. I should start learning Ukrainian; I wonder if there are any good, structured programs to do so. [[Stephanie]] would probably consider it a waste of time. How many years would it take me? What if I used SRS? I could develop a good anki system, and remember to use it and update it through roam.  Wow they aren't any good Ukrainian learning methods wtf is this.
