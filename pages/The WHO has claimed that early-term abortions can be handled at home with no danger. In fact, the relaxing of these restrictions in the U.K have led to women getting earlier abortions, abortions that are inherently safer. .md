title: The WHO has claimed that early-term abortions can be handled at home with no danger. In fact, the relaxing of these restrictions in the U.K have led to women getting earlier abortions, abortions that are inherently safer.

- Notes:
	 - A number of recent readings have led me to formulate some thoughts on the right to abortion: consciousness findings, restrictions during the pandemic, and the writings of [[J.S Mill]]. I'll take them one at a time. First, consciousness findings. It is often argued, among pro-life advocates, that life begins at conception. Yet, despite all of their claims, it is evident that humans are not even capable of consciousness until somewhere around 33 weeks of pregnancy, way before the period that most abortions occur—88% occur during the first trimester, 10% during the 2nd, and 1% during the 3rd. The vast majority of abortions (99%) occur when the fetus is not even physically capable of feeling any pain or emotion. That they have the capacity in the future to do so is another manner. Obviously we must remind ourselves, that in society, future capabilities are often touted as valid arguments for certain behaviors—you can't just kill a coma patient because they've been temporarily incapacitated. Sperm and Eggs, by themselves, have a similar capacity, but a fertilized egg, they want us to believe, is fundamentally different in some regard. Do they reject IVF treatments then? Or is it a fertilized egg in the presence of a viable womb that makes it markedly different. How much further must we go? Nevertheless, it is important to remind ourselves that the capacity argument is not one neatly decided by either stance. 

	 - I believe you can circumvent, to some extent, the popular debates surrounding abortion by simply looking at what abortion restrictions do and do not do for the absolute number of abortions performed and the time of their occurrence in pregnancies, i.e. in what trimester are they performed in. Recent lifting of restrictions in the U.K during the pandemic have led to a 25% increase of abortions that occurred in the first 7 weeks but only a 4% increase in the total number of terminations—a rise that can easily be contributed to the stress and uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Restrictions or the relaxing thereof do not change the number of abortions. Ease is not the calculus that these women use to make their decision: they will get them regardless. If you can not change these women's behavior through legislation, and if human life is your primary motivator, then you should give these women easier access to safer terminations and make their cost less impactful for these individuals. These women are people, just as much as you believe their fetuses to be.
