- Notes:
	 - Nimbyists often point to beautiful, historical cities such as [[Paris]] to argue for restrictive measures that make it harder and harder to build; however, they fail to understand that things must undergo change in order to continue to service today's generations. Paris' current infrastructure is the result of a cholera epidemic that killed thousands in over a couple of months in 1832. [[Baron Haussmann]], the young architect delegated to oversee the re-imagination of the city, had basically unfettered control in determining the future of the city. However, just as Haussmann was able to create a new Paris fit for the mid-late 1800's, so must we continue to innovate and strive to create. Paris, being one of the most iconic cities in the world, is not committed to this museum-like obsession, which is really just a way for nimbyists to justify their actions, with it's commitment to transform the city in to a greener, less car-friendly place with it's new [[Metropolis of Grand Paris]] project aimed at connecting the banlieues with the inner city. Slated for completion in 2030, it aims to add 200 kilometers of new tracks that will allow people living in the poor suburbs to connect better with the city, even at the expense of destroying some "tradition."

	 - Preservation, to an extent, is a worthy endeavor. It allows societies to remain connected to their past and encourages the forging of bonds between members. Preservation, however, should only be one force in determining the outcome of cities and their [[Urban Planning]].
