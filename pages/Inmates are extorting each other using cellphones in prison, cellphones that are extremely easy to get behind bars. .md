- Notes:
	 - Why is it so easy to get cellphones in prison? Officials don't care enough to separate and protect individuals who come forth, and the culture is probably such that it disincentives cooperation between prisoner and imprisoner. When no trust exists between the prisoner and the warden, simple seeming problems such as this can not be solved easily. 

	 - When prisons are unsafe, proper punishment can not be handed out according to the people's will. Punishments are not handed out with the assumption that an individual will receive additional punishment in prison at the hands of their fellow inmates; therefore, we should seek to stamp out these extrajudicial punishments where ever possible. Prisons are made to house individuals while they serve their time, not to expose them to new dangers.
