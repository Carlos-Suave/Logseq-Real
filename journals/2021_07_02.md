	 - Guest: [[Katy Milkman]]

	 - Notes: 
		 - Katy talks to Robert about the science of change and how to better commit to changes. She kind of says everything that Atomic Habits says and debunks a few things. One of the most interesting things that she pointed out is that self-control is not a muscle that we can really grow; it's sort of something that's limited and we can make decisions and use devices to better stick to those commitments.  

		 - Russ brings up a lot of the objections I've had with treating yourself to these little tips and tricks that kind of infantilize you into doing the right thing. Why can't I just do what I know is good for me. I can't just trick my brain into wanting to pursue future delights. I need to be more mindful.

		 - Interesting public policy angle about setting up systems in which citizens will be incentivized or driven towards making good decisions for themselves i.e. 401k tax benefits, social security, seat belt, etc. The carrot and the stick.
