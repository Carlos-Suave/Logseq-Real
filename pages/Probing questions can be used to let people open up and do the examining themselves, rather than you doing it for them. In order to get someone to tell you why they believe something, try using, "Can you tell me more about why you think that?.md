- Notes:
	 - People like to feel in control of their own decision making, therefore, you have to get people to reach conclusions on themselves. Relying on authority only works when someone highly respects or does not hold the belief too strongly. "Can you tell me more about why you think that" is a great way to get the other person to probe in to their own beliefs better. This way, you don't feel as if you're controlling the conversation or that they're in a one down situation. They remain open-minded because they are the one's convincing themselves and it shows that you're genuinely curious in what they have to say and their beliefs. Forming a connection is incredibly important, just like how connections are important for our thoughts. Connections are what allow us to effectively engage with each other and the information that we bring to one another. The hard part comes afterwards and steering them into a direction where they might realize the faults of their arguments without feeling as though you're directly attacking them. You don't ever want the other person to get on the defensive in a conversation or else they'll shut down and go into a defensive shell that'll be tough to break them out of. You have to understand that your understanding is not the only understanding. You have to know them.
