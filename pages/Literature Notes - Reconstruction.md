title: Literature Notes - Reconstruction
---

- Wade-Davis plan of reconstruction as opposed to Lincoln's
	 - Lincoln required 10% of population to be oath-takers, and to abolish slavery. 

	 - Benjamin Wade and Henry Winter Davis wanted this threshold to be raised to 50%. 

- What is a pocket veto? #Box4
	 - A refusal of a president to sign or reject a bill thus ending the session and leaving the bill dead in the water. 

- The clemency shown to southerners during reconstruction is unparalleled in human history. 

- Andrew Johnson as the only senator from a southern state to not secede. 

- Johnson appointed less than popular candidates to helm the reconstruction of state government apparatuses. 

- Who was the confederate vice president? #Box4
	 - Alexander H. Stephens

- What were the black codes? #Box4
	 - A series of rulings from state legislatures that instituted a wide range of limits on recently freed people's rights. Banning interracial marriage, vagrancy, free speech, and limits on ownership for blacks were just some of the restrictions levied. 

- Radical Republicans, who had supermajorities in both the House and the Senate, came to session in December of 1865 and wanted to punitively address the Confederates. They refused to call members seated from former Confederate states. Johnson tried to stem the stampede, but the Republican juggernaut pushed through his objections. Shortly after, they allowed the black man to vote in D.C.

- Johnson, through his use of vetoes, divided the Republicans enough to prevent them from achieving an overriding vote. He issued orders to pull out from the South and deprive the Freedman's Bureau and appointed civil service men of any enforcement powers in the South. 

- Southern race riots erupted in 1866, proving that they had no desire to work together towards a future with their fellow black citizens. In Memphis, they were slaughtered: in Norfolk, they were slaughtered: in Charleston, they were slaughtered: in New Orleans, they were slaughtered. 

- Johnson, instead doubled down on his efforts. Visiting the grave of Stephen Douglas, the man who ran against Lincoln, calling the New Orleans riots a "substantially planned" event by the Radicals who wanted to see bloodshed. He took personal offense to the hecklers and reacted improperly. Political gaff after political gaff.

- Following this, Johnson apologists lost ground and Radical Republicans gobbled it up. They gained 5 seats in both the House and the Senate and began a legislative session that barreled through the President's vetoes in astounding speedâ€”one veto, on the expansion of civil rights and immunities for blacks to equal that of whites was overridden in less than 24 hours. 

- Congress imposed 5 districts of military control over the former Confederates states.
