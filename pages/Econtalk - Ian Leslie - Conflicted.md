- What I want to Learn/how does it fit in my information network: How to communicate with people better. How to explain [[Argumentation]] and [[conflict]]. 

- Notes:
	 - [[Russ Roberts]] and [[Ian Leslie]] talk a lot about how high context vs low context affects the way that we speak. Each environment faces its own challenges. Low context can be difficult to understand the meaning behind each word and can lead to misunderstandings. [[High context]] environments are difficult to navigate, based on tradition, avoid conflict, and celebrate unanimity without conversation

	 - [[confirmation bias]] is a feature not a bug when having group discussions. It forces people to hold more strongly to their beliefs so that this sort of Darwinian process is had and only the strongest argument is produced. This is premised on situations in which everyone is committed to a common goal and truly believes in the things that they're arguing. 

	 - Conversations should contain emotion. Group think is what we evolved to do. Emotions indicate a certain level of commitment to the cause and should be treated as such. They allow you to better understand an individual.
