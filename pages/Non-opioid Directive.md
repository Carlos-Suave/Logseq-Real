title: Non-opioid Directive
---

- Tragic death of 23-year-old Max Baker, a recovered opioid addict who overdosed 1 month after receiving intraoperative fentanyl despite his pleas not to receive any opioids. 1 month later he was dead from and overdose after being clean for 2 years. 

- Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Alaska, and Massachusetts have passed such laws. 

- May be addicts, recovering addicts, are at risk of addiction, or simply want to avoid the risks of opioids. 

- Do not resuscitate is a common directive that patients sign. 

- Must coincide with the decision to not prescribe opioids after surgery. 

- Expands access and visibility to a law that has been in effect since March 28, 2019. Right now, only the MDHHS needs to have the nonopioid directive on their website. 

- There is no guarantee hospitals or medical centers will check every patient to see if they have a nonopioid directive on file with the state. 

- Protect those recovering from substance use disorders or subject to a higher likelihood of developing them. 

- There exist a number of pain management strategies that do not involve opioids. 

- The law does not apply to patients who are in hospice.

- It is not applicable to patients receiving treatment for addiction, which may include prescription opioids.

- Emergency situations are also excluded. Therefore, if a health care provider believes opioids are medically necessary, the advance directive would not apply.

- One drawback is that there is no central database for these advance directives. Therefore, if a patient has a medical emergency away from home, their records may not be accessible.

- We are at a point where schools are feeling it necessary to carry Narcan, we have to do better than this.
