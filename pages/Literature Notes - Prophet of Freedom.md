- Douglass tended to not only stress the evil of slave holding as it pertained to the slave but to the evil it inflicted upon the slaveholder.

- Douglass formed a strong bond with his fellow slaves, especially those who ended up at the Freeland farmstead with him: Henry Harris and John Harris, Handy Caldwell, and Sandy Jenkins. pg. 68

- Douglass' true happiness came from those first times he taught male slaves at Sunday school. pg. 68

- Douglass' first attempt at freedom failed due to mole; most likely, it was sandy jenkins. pg. 73
	 - Thomas Auld refused to sell Douglass, perhaps out of a sense of twisted love and affection for the young man. pg. 75

- Slave owner and slave traders relied on one another, unique partners in "blasphemy and blood."

- [[After being sent to learn caulking, Douglass endured all manner of abuse from his fellow apprentices and coworkers, most of whom were white.]]

- [[Douglass' experience as a bloody pugilist on the Baltimore streets would go on inform his ambivalent attitude towards non-violence.]]

- Douglass, in his newfound safety at Price's shipyard, found the time to join societal organizations among the large free black community. pg 78
	 - Why was he a slave and these people he viewed as his peers were free?

- Douglass was granted a limited amount of freedom in 1838, but it was stripped away after his joyous time with the free black community caused him to miss a meeting with Auld. It was then he hatched his escape plot. pg. 80
	 - His plot involved the material support from his partner Anna, and a set of outfits and documents from a sailor who provided him his sailor pass practically. pg. 81
