title: Literature Notes - But is it Art?
---

- How does the ritual theory of art fit into our understanding of art? #Box4
	 - Ritualistic art allows those of us who share belief systems to engage in behaviors that solidify or describe our place within a community. 

- What are the downsides of the ritualistic theory of art? #Box4
	 - For a ritual, the understanding and purpose of the participants must be shared and readily known. In modern art, this does not seem to be the case, as it relies on personal interpretation for much of its value. 

- Symbols of pain, suffering, or other importance to a specific community are controversial when taken outside of that setting and mixed with other symbols, threatening their sacredness. 

- Hume and Kant on the Taste argument
	 - Hume believed taste to be founded on upon the backs of a series of "experts",  who through their education and experience and consensus building among one another, would arrive upon the standard of taste for everyone else to follow.  He faces criticism, however, because his idea of taste would only be arrived upon by cultural indoctrination. 

	 - Kant tried to show that beauty, the intrinsic characteristics of the artwork itself, decided whether or not a work of art was inherently good or bad, rather than rely on our own intuitions and interpretations. Kant believed beauty was universal and grounded in the world, but was not itself objective. 

- "Purposiveness without a purpose."

- What does it mean for art to be disinterested? 
	 - It means that beauty must be freed entirely from any other uses that the perceived object might have. To say a car motor is beautiful, but only because it has the ability to go fast and work hard, would be contaminating this idea of beauty. 

- To experience the aesthetic, an object must work to stimulate our emotions, intellect, and imagination in a free play, rather than any focused, studious examination. 

- Others, such as [[Edward Bullogh]] have argued that "psychial distance" is a prerequisite for experiencing art. He argued that political or sexual subjects tended to block aesthetic consciousness. 

- What is aesthetic formalism and who is considered to be its founder?
	 - Aesthetic formalism is the idea that aesthetic values comes solely from the form of an object by way of it's purely visual or material aspects. Everything that gives the art value is contained within the artwork itself. Kant.

- Ancient tragedies introduced us to one of the oldest theories of art: imitation theory. 

- What 3 qualities were the driving factor behind gothic aesthetic principles of art and why were each important? #2
	 - Light, as it symbolized God, the light of the world, and his shining upon the house of God, the cathedral.

	 - Allegory, because it provided a way to understand God's effect upon the world. 

	 - Proportion, because it symbolized the orderly nature of the cosmos and music-like harmony between the pieces.

- In the 1600's and 1700's, gardens were seen as peek sophistication and artistry. 

- What is the [[Institutional Theory of Art]]? 
	 - The institutional theory of art states that art is any artifact that had been conferred upon as worthy of appreciation by a number of people or people's that represent/act on behalf of a social institution (the art world)

- [[Arthur Danto]], another popular art theorist, rejected this idea.

- What was [[Arthur Danto]]'s rejection of the Institutional Theory of Art? #Box4
	 - The artworld merely provides a backdrop of theory upon which artists evoke when presenting an object as art. "Nothing is an artwork without an interpretation that constitutes it as such." The artist and audience rely on a shared theory of art that allows them to see it as art. It communicates thoughts or feelings through a physical medium. 

- [[John Dewey]] believed that "art is a universal language. What does art allow us to do between cultures? #Box4
	 - Art allows us a window into other cultures by presenting us with the way that they see the world, giving us better insight than any rational explanation can. Art direct affects the attitude.

- [[John Dewey]] defined art as "the expression of the life of the community." #Box4

- [[Cynthia Freeland]], although appreciating Dewey's definition of art, argued that we needed external facts about the piece, in order to truly understand it. Facts, such as why or how a certain piece makes sense in the community. 

- [[Richard Anderson]], an anthropologist specializing in art, observed that every community reveres art in some way, and that art can be defined as "culturally significant meaning, skillfully encoded in an affecting, sensuous medium.
