	 - 1. What am I grateful for?
		 - For J and Steph really, they brighten my day and push me to be a better person everyday. I'm going to miss Steph, but I hope that I'll be in a better place when she returns.

	 - 2. What do I want todayâ€™s highlight to be?
		 - Getting my tasks done, maybe getting a call back from the car place about whether or not they could fix my car. 

	 - 3. Daily affirmations
		 - You're capable of doing anything you set your mind to; you just need to do it. Which is easier said than done to be honest. 

	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - Should I go back on vyvanse? What are the risks? I have never once been addicted to it. I just think it would allow me to maybe organize and improve my quality of life. I would tell Steph that I'm on it, but I don't think I would tell J. Why is that? Am I embarrassed. I'm not really digging typing on this laptop, but I think I might try and pawn it off onto my momma. She would be happy though so what's the harm. I'm currently fighting an urge to shut this laptop and just open my computer to do work, but I know that would just make me depressed. It's crazy how my body and brain constantly fight to remain focused.
