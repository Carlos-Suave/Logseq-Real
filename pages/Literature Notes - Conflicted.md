title: Literature Notes - Conflicted
---

- American Anthropologist Edward T. Hall introduced a distinction between two types of communication cultures: high-context and low context. 10
	 - Low context are explicit and direct. ex. Western

	 - High context are implicit and message is implied. ex. Asian countries

- How do low-context and high-context conversations/cultures differ? #Box3
	 - Low-context lays everything out explicitly and directly. There is no nuance or hidden meanings within words. High context is the exact opposite. Baked in the conversation are rules, mores, and implicit meaning. 

- What does each context require?

- [[Disagreement triggers the same part of our brain that assesses physical threat]]. 15

- Moralising language is common on the internet. 

- Moralising language increases clicks and traffic by 20 percent for each additional charged word. Incentivizes online platforms to engage in this language. 

- People hate to talk about politics; it's our least favorite topic. Political posters decrease neighborhood attractiveness. 

- 65% of start ups fail because of co founder conflict. 

- What percentages of start ups fail because of co founder conflict? #Box4
	 - 65%

- [[Kids who have a relatively high number of disagreements with their parents were happier, more successful, more adapted, as long as those weren't angry disagreements. ]]

- Metaphors shape how we argue. We tend to use war language. 22
	 - Imagine a culture, where argument is viewed as a dance: a collaborative performance, with the aim being to conduct it in the most satisfying and elegant way.  23

- In sum, this chapter introduced different [[communication]] cultures: high-context and low-context. High context cultures were mainly eastern cultures where everything was not explicitly said and it relied on shared symbols, rules, and politeness to exist. Low context cultures were mainly western cultures that relied on explicit dialogue and everything needed to be said out in the open. Less traditional. As a country, the U.S has been shifting more and more towards low-context, especially in the egalitarian way that we treat everyone. Women are no longer "expected" to do certain things that were implied. Low context leads to arguments because we aren't embarrassed. The internet is very low-context, and this low context invites disagreement, to a certain extent. People don't know how to argue. Technologies require low-context because we can't look at body posture and tone and other things we imply from in person conversations.  We treat arguments as ad-hominem, even when they're not. Angry messages and disagreements get people riled up. We are more likely to comment when we disagree with something. Everyone hates politics. Calm conflict in families leads to better outcomes. Angry conflict does not. 

- Face as a concept. Creating face is to create the image that we want others to have of us. Giving face is to confirm the other's personal image in a agreeable way. 127

- Men are just as tuned in to emotional aspects of relationships when they have the right motivation. 130

- Conversations that feature an imbalance of power tend to have one person focusing on the contents and the other focusing on the emotion.s

- [[One of the most effective ways of cooling down arguments is to de-personalize them. When people feel like their identity is being attacked, they tend to only double down. ]]

- People should not be required to defend their face in tense conversations. 136

- Chapter 7:
	 - The most important part of this chapter was about the ability to give face in relationships. It opened with the vignette of Mandela talking to white general and racist Viljoen and how he gave him the ability to save face in their interactions. A cornered, wounded, and humiliated person is dangerous; they tend to lash out. By allowing the other person to save face, you are able to prevent them from being highly emotionally charged. Another important fact is that in arguments where people feel their identity is at stake, they are a lot more protective and unwilling to acquiesce. You have to give people an out. It's like in war; if you don't give people the ability to escape, then they will resign themselves to barrelling through the offence—nothing will stop them. Like the cornered japanese at Manila, if you don't give people a way out, they will fight to the death. People who feel like they are one-down in an argument will tend to focus on the emotional aspects of things and won't be able to see logically all the time. They'll be on the defensive. You have to do your best to assure them and make them seem like an equal, even if they're not. If you have all the power, do your best to not suffocate the other person with it. 

- Culture to human beings is like water to fish: we can't see it because we live in it. 

- Chapter 8:
	 - Culture is incredibly important to understanding the ways in which people act. If you come to a conversation with a completely technocratic approach to things—overly logical, transactional, impersonal—don't be surprised if the other person's reaction isn't the same. We all act differently and we understand things differently. The best way to reach a conclusion is to understand the other person's culture and try and bridge that gap somehow. 

- When people's identities are wrapped up in new information, they find it difficult to change their beliefs. 

- By powering up you curiosity, you can defeat your biases. 

- Suspend judgment, get curious. 168

- Multiple forms of rationality. 
	 - Values rationality - adhering to your values or some higher power

	 - Instrumental rationality - the type typically associated with rationality. 

	 - affective rationality - one that focuses on relationships in deciding what to do. 

- backfire effect - bias to double down when presented with information refuting your belief.

- "In short, rather than trying to sound convincing, try to be interesting and interested."

- Chapter 9: 
	 - The chapter was all about how curiosity could help in conversations. Curiosity can help defeat biases that are ingrained such as the backfire effect and identity biases. [[Probing questions can be used to let people open up and do the examining themselves, rather than you doing it for them. In order to get someone to tell you why they believe something, try using, "Can you tell me more about why you think that?]]" this helps show that you're interested and open to what they have to say. They are much less likely to be on the defensive. This chapter also talked about how people can operate under different rationalities. Try and understand what that person values the most in this argument. 

- Immediately apologize for mistakes and do so sincerely. 

- "There is no wrong note, it has to do with how you resolve it." - Thelonious Monk

- [[The idea of [[costly signals]] - signaling information in a way that is difficult or costly to fake. ]]
	 - Commitment apologies - apologies that come with a commitment attached to them

	 - "I'm sorry, here are some flowers" the more expensive the flower the more 'cost' associated with the apology. 

	 - Englishman's apology: I'm sorry I'm an idiot. 'status apology'

	 - Deflect response: not very costly, maybe not an effective way of apologizing. 

	 - Multiple apologies make the apologies seem week.

- Apologies as a way of costly signaling something. 

- Chapter 10:
	 - Making mistakes is an inevitable part of arguing, however, they aren't always negative. Mistakes allow you to trade certain things for other things. The way to do this is by making a costly signal, one that lets the other person know your apology is sincere because it costed you something. It's important in personal relationships to prioritize warmth over competency, but that is not always the case when you are an authoritative figure. Apologies can be powerful, but don't overdo it: that can backfire. 

- Distinction between stateless and stateful conversations.

- Chapter 11:
	 - It's all about not getting stuck in the routine of argumentation. Once you do that, the conflict travels on rails until it meets it's fiery end. Throw it off by interspersing random elements of goodwill and kindness that derails the argument. Mix things up. 

- 

- Chapter 13:
	 - Never get mad on purpose. Skilled interrogators are very aware of their own feelings, tics, and behaviors and do not let them spiral out of control. We often get into spiraling attack - defend ruts because we can not accurately gauge the other person. In an experiment where participants were told to press on the other persons finger with the same force they exerted on their own finger, it spiraled until it got to about 20x the initial pressure. Don't let lower order feelings and emotions trump your rational, understanding brain. 

- Chapter 14: Be sincere, but try and find a connection. Cleverness is stupidity in these situations. They will be able to find out if you're lying to them, so don't. It's that simple. Be sincere and you'll find a connection. A human being leaves a wake behind them, as do all things with a purpose. In that wake, you'll find the meaning. People radiate meaning. Never objectify someone. We are all rational beings. 

- Chapter 15: 
	 - Civility as a way to guide argumentation. The infinite game vs the finite game. Argumentation breeds a result that is not the initial intent of either side, but something better.

	 - Assimilation is not the goal. We aim to form a union even greater than our two sides on their own.
