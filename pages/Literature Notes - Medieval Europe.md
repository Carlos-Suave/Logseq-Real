title: Literature Notes - Medieval Europe
---

- Where do these periods start and why?
	 - Artificially created

	 - [[Protestant reformation]] and subsequent catholic counter reformation had major cultural and religious changes, but led to few political and economical changes. 

	 - Why 1500 as an end date?

- European unity is a myth. Any sense of claimed identity does not match the history of the place. 

- Poor network of roads. Some inherited from the Roman Empire, but people mostly stuck to river valleys and water transport. Perhaps the largest barrier came in the form of large forestsâ€”nearly 50% of Germany was covered in forest. 

- All Medieval political communities were based on land as they were based on agriculture. 

- 4/5 of the population in the early middle ages were peasants. 

- 3 cultural trends that were more or less widespread across Europe 
	 - Honor - Theft, because it was secret, was argurably worse than homicide which was known in many parts of Europe. Violence was incredibly widespread. Homicide levels matched most violent US cities of the 20th century. Feuds were not common except in Iceland and late medieval Italy. 

	 - Gender - Women were not expected to be violent. Sometimes they weren't even people like in Ireland.

	 - Religion - Incredibly banal to say, but religion was incredibly important to the laity. To separate religious motivations from political considerations is impossible to do so: these people really believed in what they were saying and however self-serving it seemed, the two are inextricably linked. 

- Chapter 2:

- The byzantines called themselves Romans to the very end. 

- Rome did not fall, it continued with the Eastern part. 

- The [[Danube]] and the [[Rhine]] marked the distinction between Romans and 'Barbarians' quite distinctly. 

- Northern invaders, who had always been a part of Roman history, participated in a series of invasions that this time threatened political stability by taking over various provinces and raiding various cities. 

- Roman custom was to absorb the invaders, after hopefully defeating them, and integrating them into Roman society. 

- Romans used barbarians, but lost key provinces such as Carthage and were then unable to maintain the upper hand. 

- These barbarians, however, were quite roman except in name. They were essentially rogue Roman armies. They were all Christian, as well.
