	 - 1. What am I grateful for?
		 - Modern medicine.

	 - 2. What do I want todayâ€™s highlight to be?
		 - Getting a good workout in and not having the gym be filled with a ridiculous amount of people.

	 - 3. Daily affirmations
		 - You don't need caffeine to make yourself focus. You were doing fine before it. 

	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - I'm thinking of how caffeine affects my brain, and I'm hoping that I won't have to go through this all the time to find a good place to study. I should probably start saving money somehow, but food is difficult at my Dad's house. I want to get out so badly, but I need a job first. I'm worried that I won't be able to find a job that I'll actually enjoy, but I'll just have to keep looking. I've been gaining weight recently, and I know it's a tradeoff between getting covid and being out of shape, but I'm just not sure what to do. I wish our government wasn't so incompetent at doing what they ought to do; it's getting ridiculous at this point. To have no plan for dealing with the vaccine rollout is tantamount to murder. Honestly just complete bullshit.
