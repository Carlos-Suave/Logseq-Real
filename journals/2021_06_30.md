	 - Title: Max Kenner on Crime, Education, and the Bard Prison Initiative

	 - Guest: [[Max Kenner]]

	 - Tags: [[Education]] [[Rehabilitation]] [[Prison Reform]]

	 - Notes: 
		 - Bard Prison Inititive was started in 2001 as a way to deliver high quality education to prisoners in the New York State prison system. It offers around 400 inmates a curriculum indistinguishable in many ways from what Bard College offers its own students at their school. Kenner talks about the power of a liberal arts college in its ability to transform and allow individuals to become the people that they want to be. Education is one of the most cost effective ways to reduce crime and increase civic engagement . Selfish reasoning for wanting fellow citizens to be better thinkers. Noble goal of just preventing one person from like committing crimes. NY used to spend double on college education but now they spend something like 500 million more on prisons in 1990. Much cheaper to send people to college than it is to imprison them.
