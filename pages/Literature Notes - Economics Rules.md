- [[Congestion Pricing]] is an application of supply-demand principles to public transportation in that one is charged more for travelling during busy periods. It was popularized by the economist [[William Vickrey]].

- Who was the first country to attempt congestion pricing and when? #Box
	 - Singapore in 1975.

- ''A central tenet of economics holds that when it comes to the welfare of the poor, direct cash grants are more effective than subsidies on specific customer goods." pg. 4

- Models need to be specific and not over-generalize issues. They are great at solving some public problems, though. 

- "If you want to grievously wound an economist, say simply, 'You don't have a model.'"

- Outsiders take issue with economist over their oversimplification of complex social issues into concise models that have more mathematical grounding than logical grounding, jumping from abstractions to policy proposals. 

- Instead of relying on specific, purpose-intended models, economists seek the one size fits all that ends up distorting their work. 

- Models are used to capture, identify, and present salient parts of social interactions.

- Models are abstractions used to isolate potential effects from any confounding issues to get behind the actual impact of the examined effect. 

- In a competitive market economy, is it impossible to improve one person's wellbeing without reducing somebody else's. What is this called? #Box5
	 - The Pareto efficiency.

- Selecting the correct model for the correct situation is paramount to the ability of that model to accurately describe and elucidate the situation. 

- Models are only accurate to the degree that their critical assumptions are fulfilled. In the case of minimum wages, generally it will reduce employment, but that is only the case under x y and z. 

- Models can be considered fables. They approximate reality through generic situations designed to show or teach something. "It sacrifices realism and ambiguity for the clarity of its story line." The moral is the policy implication. 
	 - They remain templates for understanding the world. 

- Fables can be conflicting. They offer truth in only the slimmest of circumstances, given their assumptions are met. We must sift through our available arsenal of models to come to a conclusion. 

- Modeling is insulation, isolation, and identification. 

- Models produce different conclusions, modelling self-interested behavior can result in both efficiency, and waste—prisoners dilemma and perfectly competitive model. 

- Models unfold in our mind only. 

- What is internal vs external validity? #Box5
	 - Internal validity depends on its success in a specific setting—experiment—while external validity depends on its success outside the experimental context. 

- Models that explain reality are useless when we can't create models to predict the future when the exact conditions change. 

- What are critical assumptions? #Box5
	 - Assumptions are critical if their modification to a different, perhaps more realistic direction, would produce a substantive difference in the conclusion of the model. It depends on what the model is used for.

- Models are only useful to the extent that their critical assumptions are correct.

- Economists use math for clarity and consistency, as well as checking their own beliefs through rigid form, rather than trudging through the difficulties of constructing a solid, concise argument in plain English. 

- Large-scale computational models are too complex for the human brain to comprehend. We see what comes out of the model, but not what factors move the results. We need small-scale models to understand what's going on. 

- Successful models in terms of complexity isolate just the interactions that are theorized to matter, nothing more nothing less. This way, you can get to the bottom of things. 

- Models are relevant and teach us about the world because they're simple and easy to understand and use. Overly complex ones ignore this advantage and remain largely useless. 

- What makes models scientific? #Box5
	 - Models clarify the nature of hypotheses, making clear their logic and what factors they depend on or don't. They can open our eyes to counterintuitive possibilities and unintended consequences. 

	 - They enable the accumulation of knowledge, allowing us a set of plausible explanations for social phenomena. 

	 - They are practical in their application by being applied to actual settings. They allow us to argue.

	 - Models provide a useful method of the generation of knowledge through set, professional standards. 

- Price systems are remarkably efficient at coordinating efforts.

- It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the... 
	 - baker that we expect our dinner but from regard to their own interest. -Adam Smith

- What does the first fundamental theorem prove, and what are its limitations? #Box5
	 - It proves the invisible hand hypothesis, that under certain assumptions, the efficiency of a market economy is not just a possibility, but logically sound. It shows us the assumptions that are necessary to attain it, but this long list does not describe any actual models because of it's complexity. 

- What are the long list of prerequisites that makes the fundamental theorem unattainable? #Box5
	 - Information has to be complete. We need to rule out monopolistic behavior by producers, increasing returns to scale, and externalities. Markets must be in everything, including futures markets spanning all contingencies. 

- What does the theory of comparative advantage state? #Box5
	 - That overall gains are created when a country imports what is produces relatively less badly and imports what it produces less well. 

- Free trade can disproportionately affect certain industries and people. Not everyone wins, even if the absolute gain is there. 

- What are general-equillibrium interactions? #Box3
	 - A fancy way of saying we keep track of the feedback effects across different markets and that markets affect eachother. 

- What doesfollowing the chain of general-equillibrium interactions tend to do? #Box3
	 - It sometimes upsets the conclusion of simple supply-demand models confined to one market at a time. 

- What is the General Theory of Second Best? #Box
	 - Freeing up some markets, or opening up a market that did not exist before, is not always beneficial when other, related markets remain restricted.

- Who developed the General Theory of Second Best? #Box4
	 - James Meade

- Often times, by reducing the amount of choices one has, you can come to a better conclusion. This runs in opposition to the idea that more choices is always better.

- Economists are not like scientists who draw conclusions from hypotheses formed and tested. Their results aren't really testable in any sense of the word, and they don't formulate universal laws or what not. 

- Reliance on multiple models is necessary as the flexible nature of social reality dictates it so. 

- Knowledge accumulates horizontally in economics, not vertically. Knowledge is continually added not in a hierarchical manner, where one model might disprove another, but adding on to one another to form a more cohesive understanding of the nature of social reality. 

- What is signaling? #Box5
	 - Costly investment in certain behaviors that has no immediate apparent benefit. Degrees can be considered a form of signaling. 

- What is information asymmetry? #Box5
	 - Either buyer or seller holds more information about the benefit of a purchasem, i.e. buying a lemon from a car dealer who knows it to be so. 

- Idealized, flawless markets gave way to models of markets that fail in all types of ways. It is these ways that models may continue to help us understand the social reality of things. 

- Rule-based reasoning allows us to make quick, somewhat accurate assessments of information and allows us to store up a vast library of understanding how to react to certain situations. Case-based works via analogies. It's like [[casuistry]], the [[Jesuit]] way of thinking about certain things. 

- In economics, policy discussion usually means pitting one model against another. If you believe in a certain set of models, say in regards to how monetary and fiscal policy work in a recession, you'll believe in applying certain sets of models to help guide recovery.

- When someone asks for the underlying model, they are not asking for the entire representation of the market, they are asking for the dominant causal mechanism or channels at work. What is the most important?
	 - In a car analogy, say your car fails, and you need to find out what's wrong with it. Once you go through it bit by bit, you'll eventually get to the root of the problem, say the transmission. Now all the other pieces are causal to the movement of the car, but the dominant mechanism in causing it to fail is the transmission. The correct model is the one that highlights the critical relationships. 

- [[diagnostic signals]]. diagnosing the specific model to use occurs through the process of a decision tree that checks to see which model fits through way of deciding whether the critical assumptions within a given model are present. 

- model selection is a dynamic process.

- what is the 4 step process of verification #Box4
	 - Verifying critical assumptions of models to see that they fit the setting in question

	 - Verifying that the mechanisms posited in the model are, in fact, operating. 

	 - Verifying that the direct implications of the model are borned out

	 - Verifying whether the incidental implications, those that the model generates as a by-product, are broadly consistent with observed outcomes.

- Models often make assumptions that are critical but are unstated. For example, market liberalization models often assume there is a strong set of institutions present to ensure property rights and contracts are enforce etc. Freeing up markets where these things are not present can backfire, such is the case in many developing countries. 

- [[market-supporting institution]]

- Field experiments to date have not shown that microfinance has been particularly effective at reducing poverty. 

- We need to verify that the causal mechanism is occurring. 

- What does price is determined on the margin mean? #Box5
	 - That means that the last good produced's market value is equal to the production cost of that unit, otherwise, the market would not be in equilibrium. 

- What does the labor theory of value state and who were its proponents? #Box5
	 - That the amount of labor put into a good determines its value. Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Marx.

- Early theorists assumed that wages would hover around subsistence levels since an increase would cause a boom in population that would then naturally depress wages back to their natural equilibrium. 

- Introducing the [[Marginalists]], a group of economists. concerned with determining that prices were set by both the demand and supply side of things.
