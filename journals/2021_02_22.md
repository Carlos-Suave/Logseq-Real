	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - I know I should journal today, especially, but I really don't have the brainpower nor will to continue on. I think I should just break up with Steph; I just can't do the distance, and I don't want to be tied down to something that I don't think has a future. Maybe I'm afraid of commitment, but I don't know. It's hard, okay?
