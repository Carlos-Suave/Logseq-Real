- Expressions are made up of '     ' and '     ' #Box5
	 - Values and operators.

- What are the different types of value types you've learned so far? #Box5
	 - Integers, floats, boolean, and string

- Values can be stored in '     ' #Box5
	 - Variables.

- How are variables assigned? #Box5
	 - With the assignment operator =

- What is the execution? #Box5
	 - The instruction currently being executed

- What does the # charactersound indicate. #Box5
	 - Comments, Python ignores comments.

- What are functions? #Box5
	 - Functions are mini bits of programs that do certain things.

- What does the print function do? #Box5
	 - Prints the value inside of it.

- '      ' a function is the word for executing the function. #Box5
	 - Calling

- What does the len function do? #Box5
	 - Evaluates to the character number of the value.

- What does the str, int, len, and bool functions do? #Box5
	 - Converts the value to their respective value type.

- What are the two boolean value types? #Box5
	 - True and False.

- What are the boolean operators? #Box3
	 - and, or, not

- ==, !=, >, <, <=, >=, are all examples of what operators? #Box5
	 - Comparison

- A '     ' is a name for an expression in a flow control statement. #Box4
	 - Condition

- If condition is true, then the program will enter '      ', it will not if it is false. #Box5
	 - the indented code.

- Blocks are what? #Box5
	 - indented code.

- What statement enters the first true statement in a block? #Box5
	 - Elif

- What are truthey and falsey values? #Box5
	 - Boolean values that are true or false depending on the value.

	 - ' ' = false, all other strings are true.

	 - 0 = false, all other ints are true

	 - 0.0 = false, all other floats are true.
