title: Literature Notes - On Liberty & Utilitarianism

- When was [[J.S Mill]] born? #Box4
	 - 1806

- Who is [[J.S Mill]]'s father? 
	 - Jeremy Bentham

- What is the [[harm principle]]? 
	 - The [[harm principle]] states that your rights and liberty may only be rightfully curbed when their fulfillment would mean harm to others. His own good is not a sufficient warrant. 

	 - The actions of individuals should only be limited to the extent that they would cause harm to others.

- [[J.S Mill]] was a genuine feminist who wrote in favor of expanding women's rights and status. 

- Mill had an implicit acceptance of western colonialism: he believed that the full use of rights should only be extended to those capable of sound body and mind, qualities which he did not ascribe to "barbarians" or "backward" people. 

- [[J.S Mill]] is not the absolute utilitarian everyone believes him to be. His logical reasoning for the harm principle is not entirely 

- It has become commonly accepted to agree with, in some part, [[J.S Mill]]'s understanding of the breadth of state power and authority: harm. 

- Paternalistic legislation

- ''Light pinky of the law" may be understood as the opposing (get it?) position to the "heavy thumb of the law." Regulations that carry minor financial penalties that enforce positive behaviors people rarely afford to give either side of the issue any ideological weight are justifiable. Seatbelt laws and jaywalking laws (used properly) are amenable to Mill's rule. 

- What is the "thanks, I needed that" objection in reference to Mill's harm principle? 
	 - Allowing the state temporary authority to infringe upon someone's rights when said individual engages in potentially deadly behavior that a rational adult would not engage in unless distraught or mentally ill. 

- Mill contends that thinking about liberty has evolved from freedom from the oppressions of a powerful ruler to thinking of government as not an independent power, but a power of the people themselves that serves themselves; however, we still need freedom from ourselves in a sense, as evident by the [[French Revolution]] because the majority is not the individual.  The majority still exercises its power. 

- Social tyranny gives untold power to control individual's actions and freedoms. It reaches far beyond the power of the state (Mill clearly did not see North Korea coming) and wrests control over the very soul of a human. 

- Where is the line between social control and individual power?

- Social control emanates from the dominant social class generally.  These have created the social norms and rules that govern society, and as such, are not fit as tools of governance because they are not rationally supported. This resulted in a tendency to occupy themselves with questioning what and what shouldn't be morally permissible in society, rather than making a common cause argument in favor of freedom, even for heretics. #Box5
