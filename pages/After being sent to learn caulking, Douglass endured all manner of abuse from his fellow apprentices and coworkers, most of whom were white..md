	 - "The slaveholding class exploited the lethal tools of racism to convince the burgeoning immigrant poor, said Douglass, that 'slavery is the only power that can prevent the laboring white man from falling to the level of of the slave's poverty and degradation.'"
		 - Groups at the apex of hierarchical structures must rely on infighting among individuals at the bottom in order to ensure their continued dominance. Unless aided by extreme technological and societal instruments, such as in [[North Korea]], systems like these are untenable as eventually individuals at the bottom will band together in some shape or form. This is an assumption, and an argument certain communists find convincing, but I believe this is an easy form of manipulation that rulers have found to be effective since the beginning of time. 
			 - This mindset is still evident today as can be seen through [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]] wonderful article, "The First White President," in which Coates uses this phenomenon in his analysis of the election of President Trump. Just as Douglass saw those who interests ostensibly aligned with one another pitted against each other, Coates imagines a similar case for poor working whites. It seems that this tendency has never really gone away. If it does, we might finally see the end of racism as we know it today; however, we should be careful to imagine this as the only source of animosity. Surely, there are simply individuals not affected by this supra-structural explanation for racism; instead, they rely on personal biases or pseudo science that doesn't have such a diabolical end goal.
