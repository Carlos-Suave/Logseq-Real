		 - You just gotta remember the stuff; you can learn it just fine. 

	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - The nice lady at Martha's remembered my order. Next time, I should get her name, not out of flirtatious reasons, but just because I would like to be more like J in getting free stuff. I just have to do my best J cosplay. I would also like to start doing core every day so that one day I can do a front lever or something like that. Damn Grace got a job making 90k out of college; that's kind of crazy to me. How did she even apply for that job. She didn't even major in math haha. I guess it goes to show that anyone can do anything with the right connections and attitude. Well, you obviously have to be really intelligent and charismatic, but I think I fit those bills. So idk. It would be easier if any of these places gave me a damn interview hahaha. Maybe my resume just sucks? I have to imagine it's in the like upper 70th percentile of resumes though? Maybe that's a wild guess, but I know some of my friends don't have shit for resumes. I don't really have much to talk about today.
