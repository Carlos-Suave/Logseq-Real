	 - 1. What am I grateful for?
		 - Steph, my family, my relatively decent health (these injuries aren't the biggest issue in hindsight). Friends, such as [[Andrew]] and [[J]], who always seem to push me to do better things. 

	 - 2. What do I want todayâ€™s highlight to be?
		 - Giving my application to [[David]] for the [[staffer]] position would be a nice start. It would do wonders for my mental health regarding my motivation towards applying for jobs and would make [[Andrew]] happy. 

	 - 3. Daily affirmations
		 - You got a 31 on the ACT you're plenty of smart xd. You're also pretty handsome, so that's neat

	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - That conversation with Nigel was really out of the blue. Surely, he was trying to see if I was interested in going on a date with him or something? I don't think that I'm gay, but I always have those possible thoughts when I am around guys that are objectively attractive. I don't think this is something I want to pursue necessarily, but maybe I should tell [[Stephanie]]? I'm always thinking about my knee and wrist pain, but I'm genuinely optimistic about the future for the two. This typing thing could be an issue, but I don't think it's too bad compared to what I do at home. I expect a gradual recovery, at-least that's what I hope. 

	 - 5. What am I worried about?
		 - I'm worried about relapsing into lazy fuck mode, but I don't think that I'll do it here while I'm in [[Marquette]]. I'm confident in myself and my ability to stick to this for as long as I'm here: I'm just worried that once I go home or something that I'll fall into bad habits.
