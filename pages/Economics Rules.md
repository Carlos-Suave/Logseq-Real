	 - Quotes
		 - If you want to grievously wound an economist, say simply, 'You don't have a model.'

		 - When models are selected judiciously, they are a source of illumination. When used dogmatically, they lead to hubris and errors in policy.

		 - "Getting from 'it worked there' to 'it will work here' requires many additional steps."

		 - "Economists use math not because they're smart, but because they're not smart enough."

		 - "Remember: it is a model, not the model."

		 - "Models are never true; but there is truth in models. We can understand the world only by simplifying it."

		 - "Occasionally, empirical evidence will accumulate to the point where the profession's preference for one set of models over another will become overwhelming." 

		 - "Only card-carrying members of the profession are viewed as legitimate participants in economic debatesâ€”hence the paradox that economics is highly sensitive to criticism from inside, but extremely insensitive to criticism from outside.
