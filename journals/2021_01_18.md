	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - I'm thinking about all the things I could be doing, where my friends are in this point in their lives, how [[Quenton]] and others are getting really good jobs. I probably just need to apply myself more, but I struggle with the demands of being a perfectionist without really having the personality to be a perfectionist. I wonder if some long time ago I gave up on being a perfectionist but some weird part of my brain didn't. That would definitely help with overcoming it; If I knew that I could return to such a state naturally.
