	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - I think the source of my affection is honestly bantering, for the most part. I think when I'm unable to do that, or when someone isn't reciprocal of that , I tend to get somewhat depressed. I think that was the issue in the U.P for me; I wasn't able to get that affection. So when I did do it, it ended up being out of necessity for that kind of contact. Is it the healthiest form of affection? Probably not. Does it make those around me feel confident in our relationships? Probably not. Do I want to change it? I think that it is possible to show affection in other ways for me, but those might come off as being half baked. 

		 - I feel like I was getting shut down a lot, and I decided that I just didn't want to talk for a majority of my time here. Is it find that we operate in different ways? There's gotta be a natural outcome to all of this. I feel like there's a solution; I'm hopeful.
