	 - 4. What am I thinking of? (Brain dumping)
		 - I'm thinking of my relationship with Steph. Idk if I can do long distance, especially if I move out of state to do something. I don't really want her following me either, maybe it's a little manipulative of me. I'm kind of keeping her on a string, but I think that she knows we're most likely going to break up. I have to stop talking to Grace though lmao. It just feels wrong, especially when we don't have anything to talk about, yet we continue talking. I should just keep applying to things, getting rejected from them without an interview, and then keep talking some more. I don't see what the problem is. Maybe I'm doomed to become a policy analyst somewhere. Damn, I haven't heard back from so many places that I'm kind of scared to
