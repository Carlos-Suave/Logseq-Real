	 - Notes:
		 - Costly signals is a behavior we engage in to communicate with others that our intent is sincere and thus not easily faked or insincere. This allows others to believe us when we say or do something since we're giving something up in return. College is a costly signal that we have knowledge because of the effort, time, and money that is necessary to complete it. The more costly the signal, the more likely that whatever associated with it is to be believed. In negotiating and argumentation terms, we can use the ideas behind costly signaling to impart sincerity on our statement. For example, if we wanted to apologize for something, signaling through spending money, self-degradation, or other forms allows us to give up something to convince the other person. Sometimes, however, this signal does not work or isn't enough to convince the other person and you can come off as a liar. Perhaps by using a status apology, i.e self degradation, you can also achieve this effect.
